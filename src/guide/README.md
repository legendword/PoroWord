# Getting Started

## How The Bot Works

PoroWord primarily uses the [League of Legends API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) to gather player and match-related data. It checks periodically for new games started by linked summoners, and starts a "Betting Session" for a few minutes where your friends in the Discord server can guess the outcome of the game for a little reward!

## Disclaimer

**Coins** in PoroWord is completely an imaginary currency that is not connected to any real-world money. There is no purchasing whatsoever in this bot. It is for recreation with friends only. *Do not take it seriously.*

[Add PoroWord to Your Discord Server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=799455868957622282&permissions=2148006976&scope=bot)
